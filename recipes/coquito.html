    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that 
        originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, 
        coquito means "little coconut." The beverage
         is coconut-based and spiked with rum. 
         Rich and creamy coquito, which is often 
         thickened with egg yolks, is similar to 
         eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's 
        referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog." </p>
